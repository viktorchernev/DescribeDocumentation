This is the idea of having a directive that represents other directives.
For example, the admin of a project might add a compound directive so that authors don't need to add all the directives themselves - they just need to add the compound directive.

```
directives ->

	compound <mydrective>,
	directive 1,
	directive 2,
	directive 3,
	directive 4,
	directive 5;
```

becomes

```
directives ->

	mydrective;
```
