List to be of items of another list directly unloaded in this list as well

List items to be hoisted to another list 

a <aaa> :<bbb> -> a, b, c;
a -> :<aaa> b, c, :<ddd>











So, the idea here is to be able to get the items from another list added to this

a -> (list CCC items here), b, c;

And to be able to hoist 

a (all items go to list CCC's end/start) -> b, c, d;
