Make a JS translator - same as the JSON one, but output a javascript file instead with a variable
This can be achieved incredibly easy - just add `var JS_VAR =` and `;` to the beginning and the end of the output from the JSON translator.
The title CLI flag might be used to name this variable, if implemented, as suggested.
