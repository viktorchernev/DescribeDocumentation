What types of radio stations there are?

There are 5 major types of broadcast stations, according to the frequency band and method of transmission they use - FM, AM, Satellite, Shortwave and Internet based. FM and AM here refer to the frequency bands traditionally used for frequency and amplitude modulation, rather than the modulation techniques themselves. 

FM radio is the most commonly used for music and is the most listened to overall, with a typical range of a few hundred kilometers or less. AM has a wider range but lower audio quality, and is less popular today. There’s also HD Radio / DAB / DAB+ — digital audio transmitted over traditional AM/FM bands. Satellite radio requires a subscription and a special receiver (often built into cars), and gets its signal directly from orbiting satellites. Shortwave radio is often used for international broadcasts, including state-run news, cultural programming, and sometimes mysterious transmissions like propaganda or numbers stations. Internet radio is — well — a stream of audio over the internet. So, while it’s technically not radio in the electromagnetic sense, it works just like traditional radio for the listener, but with global reach.
