What are the perks of paid accounts?

Radiowatch will offer paid accounts in the future.

For a supscription fee of around $4/month, users will get the right to host their own private content on the platform that they choose if and how to share with others.
The ability to lock personal content for a period of time and sell early access to it. 
Removal of messages asking for donations (and ads, if we are currently using any on a given wiki).
A mention in the listiary [hall of fame].
Possible future perks we implement.
Our gratitude.
