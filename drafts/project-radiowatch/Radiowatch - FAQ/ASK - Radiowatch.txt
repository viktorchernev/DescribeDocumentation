What is Radiowatch?

Radiowatch is a wiki of lists, and is a project in the Listiary wiki farm. It is about tracking playlists on different radio stations and web streams, and is largely automated - bots create some of the content, rather than human users alone.

Radiowatch is the first wiki of the listiary project to be made available online, and serves as a kind of a test platform, as well, especially with showcasing bot accounts and bots ability to write lists/articles in a scheduled fashion.
