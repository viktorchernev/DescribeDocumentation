What are radio waves?

Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic wave—like microwaves, x-rays, gamma rays, and visible light. They're essentially photons flying through space. And yes, we can absolutely think of the light we see as light-waves. That’s because photons are both particles and waves at the same time. Weird, right? Welcome to quantum mechanics.

You can think of radio waves as a kind of invisible light — just with much longer wavelengths.

Interestingly, materials interact differently with radio waves than with visible light. Most things block, reflect, or scatter visible light, but are largely transparent to radio waves. So in a way, radio waves are like strange, ghostly lights that pass through walls, furniture — even our bodies — like shining light through a single-celled organism under a microscope.

Once upon a time, Earth’s radio background was quiet and dim. But now, with humanity lighting up the spectrum, it hums and flashes with signals beaming in all directions, all the time.
