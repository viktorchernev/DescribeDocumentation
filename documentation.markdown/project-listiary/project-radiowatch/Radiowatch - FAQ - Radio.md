The Radiowatch project, hosted at [radiowatch.listiary.net](radiowatch.listiary.net), aims to create the first-ever wiki in the Listiary wiki farm, dedicated to playlists — tracking what is being played on public FM radio stations, online streams, and more, while also letting users edit, personalize, and create their own playlists. More than just a database, Radiowatch is an interactive platform where you can listen to music, curate your own playlists, and explore what’s playing worldwide. Currently under development, the project is slated for release in 2026.

In this article, we’ll explore some frequently asked questions about basic radio broadcasting concepts.

## Why do different FM radio stations have different frequencies in different cities?

It’s not strictly about towns or cities themselves - it's about how radio towers are arranged and how they broadcast. Each radio tower covers a certain area, and to avoid interference, nearby towers must broadcast on different frequencies. If two towers were broadcasting on the same frequency and you were in range of both, your radio could pick up both signals at once, causing overlapping audio or an echo-like effect - basically, a mess. So, different frequencies help ensure you’re only picking up one clean signal at a time.

## What are radio waves?

Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic wave—like microwaves, x-rays, gamma rays, and visible light. They're essentially photons flying through space. And yes, we can absolutely think of the light we see as light-waves. That’s because photons are both particles and waves at the same time. Weird, right? Welcome to quantum mechanics.

You can think of radio waves as a kind of invisible light — just with much longer wavelengths.

Interestingly, materials interact differently with radio waves than with visible light. Most things block, reflect, or scatter visible light, but are largely transparent to radio waves. So in a way, radio waves are like strange, ghostly lights that pass through walls, furniture — even our bodies — like shining light through a single-celled organism under a microscope.

Once upon a time, Earth’s radio background was quiet and dim. But now, with humanity lighting up the spectrum, it hums and flashes with signals beaming in all directions, all the time.

## How do we use radio waves?

We use antennas to convert electric current into radio waves, and radio waves back into electric current. They’re two-way translators between the world of wires and the invisible ocean of electromagnetic radiation around us. When transmitting, antennas take electrical signals (currents) and fling them out as radio waves. When receiving, they catch bits of passing radio waves and turn them into tiny currents that your radio or device can decode.

Antennas resonate with specific frequencies of radio waves, depending on their size and shape — much like a tuning fork vibrates with a certain pitch. A receiving antenna will respond most strongly to radio waves near its resonant frequency, making it relatively "deaf" to others. This makes the antenna highly selective, allowing it to ignore most of the noise and focus on one signal. Similarly, a transmitting antenna naturally emits radio waves at its resonant frequency, which is incredibly useful—we don’t need to waste energy broadcasting across the whole spectrum just to reach one station.

When we tune in a radio to a specific frequency, we’re essentially adjusting the receiving circuit to resonate with that frequency — so the antenna and electronics become highly sensitive to just that one slice of the electromagnetic world.

## How to transmit data over radio waves?

So, we can use antennas to flood the world around us with radio waves of a particular frequency, and we can use antennas to observe the flood of radio waves shining around us in a particular frequency, but how do we use that fact to transmit data? 

We can send data by creating a stream of radio waves of a particular frequency and fluctuating it a bit, introducing some changes. And we can receive data by observing the flood of radio waves of a particular frequency around us and figuring out what changes and fluctuations have been introduced, and interpreting what they mean. We only need to be in range and know what frequency to observe. 

The act of blasting radio waves around, especially with some encoded information in it, is called "broadcasting". The process of fluctuating the stream of radio waves we are blasting around is called "modulation", and the stream of radio waves we started with, before encoding the fluctuations, is called 'a carrier wave' (which is a collective term - like we would call the lights of many light bulbs "the light of the bulbs", we call the waves of many transponders "the wave of the broadcast")

Two methods of modulation have became widespread with radio stations - amplitude modulation, and frequency modulation - thus, frequency modulated radio, or "FM radio" and amplitude modulated radio, or "AM radio".

If we imagine the radio frequency we are tuned in as a kind of light, which it actually is, amplitude modulation will be alternating the brightness, while frequency modulation will be alternating the color of the light. But wait - you might ask - we are tuning in on a frequency, and then changing it by doing frequency modulation - won't that tune us out? Not quite — the frequency changes are small and stay centered around the original carrier frequency, and our radios are designed to follow these subtle shifts.

## What types of radio stations there are?

There are 5 major types of broadcast stations, according to the frequency band and method of transmission they use - FM, AM, Satellite, Shortwave and Internet based. FM and AM here refer to the frequency bands traditionally used for frequency and amplitude modulation, rather than the modulation techniques themselves. 

FM radio is the most commonly used for music and is the most listened to overall, with a typical range of a few hundred kilometers or less. AM has a wider range but lower audio quality, and is less popular today. There’s also HD Radio / DAB / DAB+ — digital audio transmitted over traditional AM/FM bands. Satellite radio requires a subscription and a special receiver (often built into cars), and gets its signal directly from orbiting satellites. Shortwave radio is often used for international broadcasts, including state-run news, cultural programming, and sometimes mysterious transmissions like propaganda or numbers stations. Internet radio is — well — a stream of audio over the internet. So, while it’s technically not radio in the electromagnetic sense, it works just like traditional radio for the listener, but with global reach.
