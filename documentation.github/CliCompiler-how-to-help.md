### help

The help command is used to display usage / help message

```DescribeCompilerCLI help```<br>
```DescribeCompilerCLI -h```<br>

<span style="color:orange">_help [ auto ] | -h [ auto ]_</span><br>

* <span style="color:blue">**_auto_**</span><br>
The auto flag specifies that the tool is being invoked from a script or a tool. Essentially it removes stuff like changing console colors and prompts like ```Press any key to exit.```, as those can break or complicate automated scripts and tools.
