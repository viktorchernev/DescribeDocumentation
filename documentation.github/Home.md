Describe is a domain specific markup language designed to write and maintain complex data lists that are compiled on demand to various formats, such as html, xml, sql and json. It is simple to use, intuitive and easy to master. Describe is readily extendible - implementing support for new target languages or customizing the transpilation process is straightforward, making it adaptable to a wide range of projects.
