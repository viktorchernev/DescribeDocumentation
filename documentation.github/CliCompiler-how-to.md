The Describe Compiler CLI is a text-based app that provides a command line interface for the API compiler, so that users can compile Describe source files on the command line. The app is licensed under the [AGPL v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0) public license, and is currently available only for Windows, utilizing the .Net 8.0. Linux build will probably be available in the near future as well.
