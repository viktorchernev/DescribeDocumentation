When parsing the given file, we get error:

	line 214:17 no viable alternative at input 'May {nlcomment},\r\n\r\n  '
	"C:\Users\Viktor Chernev\Desktop\Lists-Cli\MyLife\MyJob\job01-2024.ds" - failed to unfold tree: The child at index 1 of the provided Expression_listContext is not a valid ExpressionContext. (Parameter 'context')

It has to do with the empty entries at the end and the comment, because when I remove those, everything is fine.
Also, we seem to be parsing `Week 17 -> empty {comment};` as a single comment entry, instead of a production. 
Something is off with that file...

-------------------------------

No unfold error, was just some faulty test data, again.
See below the correct one.
