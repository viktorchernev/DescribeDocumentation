This folder contains the current change-log for the project.
Older versions change-logs are available in the documentation - https://documentation.listiary.com/language/reference/versioning/ - and might not be present here, while feature ideas to be implemented have accumulated in the 'next' folder.

v 0.9.4 was never released, and instead became v 1.0.0-beta, so most features and bug-fixes implemented in developing 0.9.4 have been carried to 1.0.0, although the codebase have been partially rewritten to implement ANTLR 4 as a parser engine, so some might've been removed from the code-base - especially ones related to the old GOLD based parser.
