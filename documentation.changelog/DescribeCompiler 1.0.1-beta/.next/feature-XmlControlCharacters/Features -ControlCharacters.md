Control Characters and Exotic spaces

Most ASCII control characters (values from 0x00 to 0x1F) are not allowed, except for tab (0x09), line feed (0x0A), and carriage return (0x0D).
Characters in the range of 0x7F-0x84 and 0x86-0x9F are also disallowed. These are mostly control characters in the higher ASCII range.
Special Rules for Character Data
XML 1.1 relaxes some of the restrictions from XML 1.0:

XML 1.0 does not allow most control characters (0x00-0x1F and 0x7F-0x9F) or any characters beyond 0xFFFF (i.e., outside of the Basic Multilingual Plane).
XML 1.1 allows virtually any character from the Unicode set, including those above 0xFFFF (i.e., in supplementary planes), and it permits most of the control characters if they are properly escaped as character references (e.g., &#x1; for the start of heading character).
Best Practices
When working with XML, it’s crucial to:

Always use a library for XML generation and parsing to handle character encoding correctly and ensure your XML documents are well-formed.
Be aware of which version of XML you are working with (1.0 vs. 1.1) as it affects which characters are permissible.
Handling characters correctly ensures that XML documents are robust, portable, and free of parsing errors.




SecurityElement.Escape in the .NET Framework is specifically focused on escaping the special XML characters (&, <, >, ", ') to ensure XML documents are well-formed. It does not directly address issues related to control characters or exotic spaces, which might still cause issues in XML documents or other contexts. Here’s a bit more detail:

Control Characters
Control characters, especially those in the ASCII range from 0x00 to 0x1F (excluding the commonly used whitespace characters like tab (0x09), line feed (0x0A), and carriage return (0x0D)), are generally not allowed in XML content. SecurityElement.Escape does not convert these control characters into a safe format, meaning they could still cause your XML to be malformed or lead to parsing errors if included. In XML 1.1, these characters can be included using character references (e.g., &#x01;), but you would need to handle this manually or ensure your XML processing tools support XML 1.1.

Exotic Spaces
There are several types of whitespace characters in Unicode, such as no-break spaces, em spaces, en spaces, thin spaces, etc. These are not typically a problem in XML content in terms of document parsing, as XML treats them as valid whitespace characters. However, SecurityElement.Escape does not alter or specifically encode these space characters since they are not problematic for XML syntax as the special characters listed above are.

Best Practices for Handling Control Characters and Exotic Spaces
If you need to ensure your XML is free of unwanted or potentially problematic characters such as control characters, or if you want to handle exotic spaces in a specific way (for example, converting them to regular spaces), you might consider implementing additional processing steps such as:

Filtering out control characters: Before processing text for XML insertion, you could use a regular expression to remove non-printable characters from strings.
Normalizing spaces: If the presence of various types of spaces could lead to issues in your application or outputs, consider normalizing all whitespace to a standard space character, unless specific formatting is required for your application.
