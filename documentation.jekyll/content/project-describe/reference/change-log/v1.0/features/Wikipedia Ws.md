<br>_FEATURE: Wikipedia Ws, Youtube Ys_<br>

All links show 'A' in a dot, but wikipedia ones should show 'W' instead. But this is not the case with the HTML translator, and possibly with other translators as well.
<br>
Feature has been implemented in the inbuilt HTML translators - there is logic to recognize link URLs from specific sites, and wikipedia ones are green and show 'W', while youtube ones are red and show 'Y'.<br>

Support for more sites will to be implemented in future versions.
