The Describe Compiler project uses semantic versioning. The Describe compiler is currently in a version 1.0.1 which is an open beta.<br>

Version 0.9.4 was never released - instead it became integrated as a part of version 1.0. We call it Transpiler now, because this is the proper term for a tool that outputs another high-level language. However, the two terms are used interchangeably throughout the project.<br><br>

## history
First, a simple and rudimentary mock application was hacked together, that was called "Test Gadget". It had no real parser engine and used simple logic. In time it grew in complexity and became the Describe Compiler. Below is the source code, as a curiosity.<br><br>
