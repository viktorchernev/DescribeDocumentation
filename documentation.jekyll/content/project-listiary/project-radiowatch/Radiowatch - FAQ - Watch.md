The Radiowatch project, hosted at [radiowatch.listiary.net](radiowatch.listiary.net), aims to create the first-ever wiki in the Listiary wiki farm, dedicated to playlists — tracking what is being played on public FM radio stations, online streams, and more, while also letting users edit, personalize, and create their own playlists. More than just a database, Radiowatch is an interactive platform where you can listen to music, curate your own playlists, and explore what’s playing worldwide. Currently under development, the project is slated for release in 2026.

In this article, we’ll explore some frequently asked questions about the project.

## What is Radiowatch?

Radiowatch is a wiki of lists, and is a project in the Listiary wiki farm. It is about tracking playlists on different radio stations and web streams, and is largely automated - bots create some of the content, rather than human users alone.

Radiowatch is the first wiki of the listiary project to be made available online, and serves as a kind of a test platform, as well, especially with showcasing bot accounts and bots ability to write lists/articles in a scheduled fashion.

## How Radiowatch works?

Radiowatch is a listiary wiki dedicated to creating and curating information about various FM and web-based radio stations - mostly where to listen and a historic record of the songs played. There are also numerous playlists users create and share, radio websites and apps, artist and song directories, etc.

Radiowatch works as any normal listiary wiki - users can read the content freely and registered users can contribute data.
Users can also create their personal content, that others can browse, and paid users can also create private content, that only they can access.
This wiki also relies on bots to automate some of the article creation process.

Radiowatch offers a radio player for direct audio streaming in the website. When users play content on it, they have the options to opt in and act as observers - sending back to our database the titles of the songs they are listening to as they appear in the metadata of the stream they are listening to. We run that information through our bots that consult our knowledge database of songs and construct the historic record articles for the station, adding as much additional knowledge as available. 

Users can also create and run their own bots.

## Is Radiowatch free?

Short answer:
Kind of. You can use the service for free, but we might ask for donations or show advertisements in a pop-up when you are opening the site.

Long answer: 
We feel that ads are annoying at best, and evil, subversive and exploitative at worst. We also feel that locking out users who are not able to pay - and often those are the people who need access to knowledge the most, is evil and wrong. But we need to pay for the servers to survive, and pay ourselves some wages so that we can keep developing the wiki farm and the open source markup language "Describe" that powers it. We hope to be able to do that via donations and from offering premium-tier user accounts. But while we can't do it smoothly, we will sometimes ask you to donate money in a pop-up message, or rely on our blend of limited advertising. 

However, even if we must rely partially on ad revenue to survive for some time, there are some rules. We will not use targeted ads or share user data with advertisers. We will not allow sponsored content, or include ads in the regular user experience in any way shape or form, and we will not allow ads for questionable products or services - like gambling, payday loans or over-priced low quality trendy items. 

Basically, you will get a pop-up to watch one or two anonymous ads when opening the website tab, rarely during the day. You will have the option to donate as low as 1$ to remove the ads for a month. There will also be a section where you can go and watch ads as a form of donation to us in advance, when you have time, so that ads don't bother you for some time. We regret that, but if it must be done for some time, we will rather do it than fail the platform.

## What are the perks of paid accounts?

Radiowatch will offer paid accounts in the future.

For a subscription fee of around $4/month, users will get the right to host their own private content on the platform that they choose if and how to share with others.
The ability to lock personal content for a period of time and sell early access to it. 
Removal of messages asking for donations (and ads, if we are currently using any on a given wiki).
A mention in the listiary [hall of fame].
Possible future perks we implement.
Our gratitude.
