The Radiowatch project, hosted at [radiowatch.listiary.net](radiowatch.listiary.net), aims to create the first-ever wiki in the Listiary wiki farm, dedicated to playlists — tracking what is being played on public Internet/FM radio stations, online streams, and more, while also letting users edit, personalize, and create their own playlists. More than just a database, Radiowatch is an interactive platform where you can listen to music, curate your own playlists, and explore what’s playing worldwide. Currently under development, the project is slated for release in 2026.
