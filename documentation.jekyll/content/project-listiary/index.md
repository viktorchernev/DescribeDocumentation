<br>While Describe is a markup language for writing complex lists, Listiary is a wiki software for such lists, powered by Describe. The same way as Wikipedia, where users write articles in Wiki markup, in Listiary users write lists in Describe markup.

Describe is built and developed for Listiary, but can also be used on its own. Describe is free and copyleft-ed, while Listiary is proprietary, at the present.
