The Documentation project - also known as "Listiary documentation", "Describe documentation", or simply "the Documentation" - is a project aimed at building and maintaining a collective knowledge-base for anything pertaining to the Describe markup language and Listiary - the wiki farm powered by the markup.  
<br>
We have chosen a static site builder - "[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)" - in order to have "text files to website" pipeline that is as effortless as possible, while the result is still a responsive website with decent look and feel that requires no maintenance. At that, Jekyll looked as a straight-forward and reversible solution. Other options are - Hugo, Eleventy, Astro, Netlify CMS, Webflow / Notion.
